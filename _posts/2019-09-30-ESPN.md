A lot has been made recently about ESPN’s supposed decline. A few extremely prominent names at ESPN such as NFL reporters John Clayton and Ed Werder, along with anchors like Jay Crawford, were included in huge layoffs that left around 500 former ESPN-ers without a job in the past few years. They’ve also experienced a huge drop in subscribers that’s affecting the dual-revenue model that has brought them so much success over the years. This dual-revenue comes from cable fees that customers must pay for their TV to have access to ESPN, as well as the advertisements the company then sells based on that subscriber number. The decline in subscribers not only brings in less revenue from the fees, it also lowers ESPN’s leverage when negotiating with advertisers. To add insult to injury, Additionally, the President has been making fun of the sports giant on Twitter for these subscriber losses and supposed liberal bias, which may even turn off more fans. Some people, including Trump, believe that this might be the end of ESPN’s dominance over the sports media landscape.

However, that’s only telling one side of the story. Considering that ESPN still has over 8000 employees, the layoffs no longer seem quite as consequential. Especially after realizing that ESPN is also expanding and hiring new employees in other employment areas. They are beefing up their social media presence and needed new anchors to host their daily Sportscenter snapchat edition. Additionally, they are creating an entirely new platform for content, which takes an entirely new team to accomplish. ESPN+ will require an additional per month subscription fee to get access to this exclusive streaming content, putting some of that lost revenue back in ESPN’s pockets. Its live streaming content will include streaming of more obscure sports that do not often get shown on the flagship ESPN TV station, such as boxing, cricket, rugby, and more. By now including this programming on this platform, ESPN is opening up the wallets of a brand new market that used to have no need to subscribe to anything the channel, which will expand their reach, especially globally. Their app has also been improved, and in general, especially if you choose to focus on the cyber side of things, it appears more as if ESPN is simply evolving rather than declining. They noticed the switch in the industry towards digital, and have decided to capitalize on it in order to stay ahead of its competitors.

Although with the industry-wide trend of cable cutting, ESPN’s subscriber counts are rapidly declining, it would be a reach to say that ESPN is in any major trouble as a company. They still offer by far the most live sports, and they own so many of the rights to these sports that no other companies are truly able to compete. This is especially important today, where live sports represent the small fraction of programming that is DVR-proof, and must be watched live for peak enjoyment. This means the ads are unskippable, and must be watched too, making live sports premium content for advertisers, which is good news for ESPN. This, along with their commitment to embracing digital, means that rumors of ESPN’s death have been greatly exaggerated.
