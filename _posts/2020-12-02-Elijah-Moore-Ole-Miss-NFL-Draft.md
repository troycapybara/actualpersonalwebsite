I was first introduced to Ole Miss Rebels standout Wide Receiver Elijah Moore last year, in 2019. Moore is not the prototypical build that you would choose for a player of his position if you were to [build the perfect specimen](https://thedraftnetwork.com/articles/building-the-perfect-nfl-wide-receiver) for your NCAA Football 14 Road to Glory Player on the Xbox 360. (EA, if you're reading this, PLEASE bring the NCAA Football series back.) At 5 feet 9 inches, he is considerably smaller than the average NFL wide receiver who is 6 feet 1 according to [this](https://www.footballperspective.com/average-height-of-defensive-backs-and-wide-receivers) article from FootballPerspective.com. However, Elijah does have something going for him that will cause NFL scouts, general managers, and coaches across the league to take notice. After week 13, Moore is currently leading the entire NCAA in receiving yards. His 1,193 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns are even more impressive when you consider that his team, Ole Miss, has played considerably fewer games than other teams in the country due to the SEC getting a late start this year due [to fallout from Covid-19](https://www.si.com/college/2020/07/30/college-football-sec-schedule-2020). 

However, there’s another piece to the story that may make NFL teams think twice before using a pivotal 1st or 2nd round draft choice on him. In the most infamous play of his career, and one of the most infamous in the history of the [Egg Bowl,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_Bowl) (the bitter rivalry between Ole Miss and their in-state rivals the Mississippi State Bulldogs) Elijah caught a 2 yard pass from QB Matt Corral for a touchdown with just 4 seconds left. However, immediately after securing the huge touchdown, he began crawling on the ground and stuck his hind leg up to mimic the Bulldog logo of his rival’s team taking a pee, in one of the most jaw-droppingly hilarious I’ve ever seen on a football field. Chaos then ensued, with the resulting 15 yard penalty from the celebration causing a more difficult extra point for Kicker Luke Logan, which Logan then missed. Moore’s celebration directly caused the Rebels to lose 21-20 to their most hated rival, which might cause some teams to think he has a lack of discipline in big moments.

This is one of my favorite moments in College Football history, and I admit, I clowned on Moore for it for a little while. But he came out this season re-focused on his goals, and it’s shown on the field so far this year. In addition to leading the NCAA in receiving yards, he also [broke](https://www.si.com/college/olemiss/football/elijah-moore-breaks-a-j-browns-ole-miss-receptions-record-in-egg-bowl) the Ole Miss single season receiving yards record in this year’s edition of the Egg Bowl, taking it away from current Titans star AJ Brown. Also, keep in mind that he’s done this in far less games than every other receiver who’s played there has had. And Ole Miss has had no shortage of Wide Receiver talent throughout the years, with players like Brown, Seahawks standout DK Metcalf, super athletic Laquon Treadwell, and solid NFL starter Mike Wallace. 

Which brings us to the question: should Elijah Moore be a 1st or 2nd round pick in the 2021 NFL draft? I think the answer is that we have to wait and see. He’s clearly grown as a person since the Egg Bowl incident, and he wants to put that all behind him. He told [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30382478/a-year-infamous-leg-lift-elijah-moore-looks-redemption-latest-egg-bowl) he would continue to learn and grow "[n]ot even to prove to everyone else, but just to prove to myself that an action like that wasn't myself. Just to learn from it. That's been the best part. Having a lesson like that to be learned and to grow from it and for people to see the growth." In terms of raw natural talent, Moore, who was a [4 star recruit](https://247sports.com/player/elijah-moore-82387/), 38th ranked WR in his class coming out of high school, has always been gifted. I think we saw him take the next step that scouts would be looking for in his career this year, and he certainly proved that he can make plays when provided the opportunity. If he can continue to hit the weights, as he’s been doing, and build on that speed and explosiveness that we’ve seen from him this year, he could really impress some teams at the combine. Add that to his play this year, and I think that Elijah Moore should be in the conversation for any team looking to add a WR in the 2021 NFL draft.
