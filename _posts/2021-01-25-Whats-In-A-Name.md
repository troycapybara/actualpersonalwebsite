What’s in a name? Today, I take it upon myself to answer that question. Well, to start, a name is an identification, usually of letters, that helps to identify a person, place, or thing. The letters caveat is in there because Elon Musk was one of the thousands of folks who “broke the internet” over the last half decade of that phrase’s overuse by naming his kid something dumb like X-Æ-12 or something else equally asinine, don’t feel like googling “elon musk kid name” and adding to that Google Trend any more than at all necessary because that kid is already going to be scarred enough. And there was also that one kid from the Peanuts comic strip who was named 5 because his Dad was suffering from some sort of weird existential crisis, I always thought that was pretty cool as a 10 year old.

Names typically have a few different parts for a greater level of specificity. In the United States of America where I live, I was assigned a First, Middle, and Last name at birth, and then later when I was about 13 I was asked my the religious tradition I grew up with to take a “Confirmation name” to confirm my belief in God or something. Unfortunately, I had procrastinated reading the 783,137 word long Bible over the first few years of my life (or maybe not, can’t remember) and then had to learn to read so I couldn’t really get through the whole thing. Then I just panicked and chose Paul. Paul is a good character from the Bible though even though Paul is a bad name so I could have done worse. Sorry if you’re reading this and your name is Paul by the way.

My first name is Troy. The name Troy has a storied history going all the way back to the year 2004 AD when a guy named Brad Pitt popularized it and won a Teen Choice Award for it. But to my surprise, the name actually goes back even further than that. You may be like me, wondering “what does the name Troy mean?” It’s a little bit worse for me to be wondering this because I’ve had this name for 23 years but you’ll have to give me a pass because for over half of that time I was busy picking out “Paul.” In English speaking countries, the name is thought to derive from the Irish troightheach, which means foot soldier. So unlike other names that were derived from occupations, mythology, or biblical figures, the etymology of my name just means guy with two feet that is actively trying to commit mortal sin against his fellow man. Alternatively, the name may also be of Classical Greek inspiration, from the ancient city of Troy where the Trojan War happened, and were later immortalized in some of the most famous works ever, the Iliad, the Odyssey, and High School Musical 3: Senior Year, all written by famous poet Homer Simpson. The Trojan War was when some guy like 3000 years ago was horny, and now we have condoms named after it. That’s what my name means in the literal and classical senses, but really I was just named Troy because my mom’s favorite quarterback at the time was Troy Aikman. At least I wasn’t named OJ.

Then there’s also a middle name. My middle name is Kenneth, which I always liked even though kids at school always made fun of me for it and people still chuckle when I tell them. I was named after my grandpa whose name is Kenneth and he’s really cool. It’s a pretty common naming trope to just name things after great things that have come before them. Pretty lazy but after a 9 month pregnancy that sounds like the physical embodiment of hell in pretty much every way I’ll give mothers a pass.

Lastly, there’s the last name. My last name is Demers, which I have mixed feelings on. It’s a decent name that’s pretty far up in the alphabet without being too close to the beginning, but no one ever pronounces it right. I’ve been told that the name Demers is French-Canadian, and if you look at the Wikipedia page for the name you do see a lot of hockey players and coaches so it kind of checks out. A lot of my dad’s family played hockey including my dad himself, and my dad’s great uncle or something, Pete Demers is even in the hockey hall of fame. But the website SurnameDB says that it’s an English name but since 300 years after the Norman Conquest of 1066 French was the official language of England it just looks French. Regardless, I’m not really sure, but I’m certainly very white no matter which way you slice it. 

Anyway, that’s what names are. I hope this article helps answer the question “what’s in a name?” Hope you learned a lot from this post and I’d love to hear the origin of your names on twitter @troykdemers
