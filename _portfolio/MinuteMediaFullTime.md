I love working for Minute Media. Every day there's a new challenge to face which keeps me on my toes, and the fact that we own so many great content properties means there's so many great verticals to explore for new influencers. Plus, my coworkers couldn't be a nicer, more determined, and bright bunch. Here's some of what I currently handle at MM.

1. Responsible for day to day management of relationships with influencer accounts, new influencer outreach, and cost/performance analysis for MM’s network of thousands of influencers.
2. Built influencer program for [FanSided’s](https://fansided.com/network/entertainment/) Entertainment sites from 0 in June 2020 to 2.3 million pageviews in December 2020. <br/>

3. Boosted influencer program for [Mental Floss](https://www.mentalfloss.com/) from 13 million pageviews in 2019 to 44 million pageviews in 2020, increase of 238%.

4. Yielded most-cost effective and engaged options for direct campaigns  with budgets of thousands of dollars, then gathered all relevant data and reported performance for the client.
5. Diligently monitored traffic quality for all influencers across MM’s several brands in Google Analytics and Data Studio.
6. Ensured proper deployment of ads on all platforms and reported synthesized data to management in order to maximize ROI.
7. On-camera talent for FanSided’s [Sport & Order.](https://www.facebook.com/fansided/videos/372000297431587/)
