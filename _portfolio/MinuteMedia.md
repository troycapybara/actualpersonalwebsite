In the summer of 2018, I completed an internship with 12up, a division of Minute Media. Minute Media is a fast growing digital media startup that was founded in order to give sports fans a voice in sports journalism. Through proprietary cutting-edge technology, they strive to encourage the next generation of fans and social influencers to create, distribute and consume more than 1,000 pieces of curated content, through 12 languages, every day. This mix of talent and tech has propelled them to the status of a top-10 US sports brand. </br>

I joined the 12up team as a social media intern, and immediately took on a large role, wearing several different hats in support of the company. My main goal was to assist in driving the millions of impressions that the hundreds of Minute Media social properties generate across all platforms. I worked hand-in-hand with their editorial team and coordinated influencer marketing to drive traffic to the site. </br>

My day to day responsibilites included this influencer marketing coordination, aggressive guerrilla marketing on Twitter, and managing as well as creating content for a community of around 20 unique Facebook pages. Content that I would create for these pages would often gain more impressions than total number of page likes, which proves the content was engaging and shareable. This Javy Baez meme gained more than 440,000 impressions, 8x more than the 57,000 likes the page initially had. Which is what we in the ~biz~ like to call "viral." </br>

The reason I knew that these Cubs fans loved that player so much was because I practiced social listening by monitoring these communities I managed so that I could optimize engagement on content. This is part of the human and intimate aspect of social that I love so much and continues to draw me to this industry. Lastly, as a part of this internship I would give monthly social reports on my posts, as a way to let my bosses know how my content was performing, as well as synthesizing the information for myself.
