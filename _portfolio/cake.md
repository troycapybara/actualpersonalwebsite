In fall of 2018, a team of 3 other Advertising students and I created a complete advertising strategy and executed a multi-channel campaign for our Strategic Advertising Campaign Development class. </br> </br> We tackled the challenge presented by the National Student Advertising Competition (NSAC) for their annual student competition: how to make hot dogs a little bit less scary. The competition was sponsored by Wienerschnitzel, a fast food chain that sells hot dogs. In completing this task my group and I did a situational analysis of the industry, as well as analyzing Wienerschnitzel's unique brand position in this space. We also created unique customer profiles to try and better encapsulate the target market for this campaign. Next, we drafted a creative brief, and then finally made and then executed our creative concepts. </br> </br> Elements of our idea was incorporated into the final campaign Marist presented at NSAC and won third place!
