Troy Demers is a 22 year old recent graduate from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY

Since it's weird to speak about yourself in the third person, 
/I/ am currently seeking a job working creatively!
I have a background in social media / digital marketing, completing two internships in the field.
1. Running the entire social media show (Instagram, Twitter, Organic Facebook, Paid Facebook Campaigns, Landing Pages, Website Renovation, Social Media Strategy, Content Creation, Photography) for a [local nonprofit](http://www.casaofmiddlesexcounty.org/).
2. Working with a top-10 US sports brand, ([12up](https://www.12up.com/), division of [Minute Media](https://www.minutemedia.com/)) driving millions of impressions across hundreds of social media properties. I worked hand in hand with their editorial team and a team of influencers to drive traffic. My day to day involved the management of 25-30 unique Facebook fan pages.

I also do and like other things too. I'm a photographer, [videographer + editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXe8vhIlnxU), [video essayist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5yhrvL8e-k&t=35s), poet (and I do, in fact, know it), writer, and big content guy.

Follow my twitter and let's chat! @troykdemers
