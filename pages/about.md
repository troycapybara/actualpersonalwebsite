Troy Demers is an Influencer Marketing Manager from Bloomfield, NJ.

I wear so many hats at my current role that sometimes my head can't fit all of them. Here's a few highlights: 
1. Responsible for day to day management of relationships with influencer accounts, new influencer outreach, and cost/performance analysis for MM’s network of thousands of influencers.
2. Built influencer program for [FanSided’s](https://fansided.com/network/entertainment/) Entertainment sites from 0 in June 2020 to 2.3 million pageviews in December 2020
3. Boosted influencer program for [Mental Floss](https://www.mentalfloss.com/) from 13 million pageviews in 2019 to 44 million pageviews in 2020, increase of 238%.
4. Yielded most-cost effective and engaged options for direct campaigns  with budgets of thousands of dollars, then gathered all relevant data and reported performance for the client.
5. Diligently monitored traffic quality for all influencers across MM’s several brands in Google Analytics and Data Studio.
6. Ensured proper deployment of ads on all platforms and reported synthesized data to management in order to maximize ROI.
7. On-camera talent for FanSided’s [Sport & Order.](https://www.facebook.com/fansided/videos/372000297431587/) 


Before taking my current role, I already had an extensive background in social media / digital marketing, completing two internships in the field.
1. Running the entire social media show (Instagram, Twitter, Organic Facebook, Paid Facebook Campaigns, Landing Pages, Website Renovation, Social Media Strategy, Content Creation, Photography) for a [local nonprofit](http://www.casaofmiddlesexcounty.org/).
2. Working with a top-10 US sports brand, ([12up](https://www.12up.com/), division of [Minute Media](https://www.minutemedia.com/)) driving millions of impressions across hundreds of social media properties. I worked hand in hand with their editorial team and a team of influencers to drive traffic. My day to day involved the management of 25-30 unique Facebook fan pages.

I also do and like other things too. I'm a photographer, [videographer + editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXe8vhIlnxU), [video essayist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5yhrvL8e-k&t=35s), poet (and I do, in fact, know it), writer, aspiring guitarist, and big content guy.

My less productive hobbies include spending weekends watching football (both College and NFL) and hockey, playing video games with my friends (NCAA Football 14, The Binding of Isaac, Civilzation 6, and Rocket League are some of my favs), and listening to music (preferably live at a small venue).

I've also been getting into the stock market and crypto, but it largely remains to be seen where that falls on the productivity scale.
