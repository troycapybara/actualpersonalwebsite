Click [the link](https://troy-demers.my-online.store/) to check out the E-Book I've created of my poetry. <br/>
For my Honors Senior Thesis I wrote a bunch of orginal poems, each with a corresponding art piece, <br/>
and a PDF of those poems and drawings now live at the link above for just $3.79! <br/>
If you don't have $4 to spare...guess we're in the same boat! Up top! *high fives you*
