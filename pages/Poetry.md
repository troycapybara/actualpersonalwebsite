Click (the link)[https://troy-demers.my-online.store/] to check out the E-Book I've created of my poetry. 
For my Honors Senior Thesis I created a bunch of orginal poems, each with a corresponding art piece,
and a PDF of those poems and drawings now live at the link above for just $3.79!
If you don't have $4 to spare...guess we're in the same boat! Up top! *high fives you*
