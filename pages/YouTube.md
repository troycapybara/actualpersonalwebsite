One of the biggest passions throughout my entire life has been making YouTube videos and posting them for the world to see. As a 12 year old making silly videos with my friends and expressing myself through song parodies I never thought I'd reach 500 subscribers and even crazier $500 DOLLARS (roughly $1 million in teenager-money). After a ruthless period of high-school bullying led to those videos being privated (no, you CAN'T see them) I rebooted my channel with random videos that I got the urge to make, including Advertisement reviews and episodes of the radio show I put on at school. My YouTube was truly revived in the spring semester of 2019, when for my Honors Senior Thesis I decided to film a series of video essays on the poets I covered. It was so fun to get back into the lab and relearn editing techniques, and I loved getting behind the camera again. Some of the videos will be embedded below and to visit my channel, click [the link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAfBokrihGD-HmcsoxO7WjA/videos).
